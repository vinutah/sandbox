# i18n

Internationalization.  What a long word, am I right?  Because there are
eighteen letters between the first and last, it is often abbreviated as i18n
(I-eighteen-N), which is so much shorter!

Lucid Software recently internationalized its products and translated them into
many different languages.  Ising "i18n" instead of "internationalization" has
saved a lot of time in conversations.  We want to do this more.

Apply this same abbreviation method (replacing the inner characters with the
number of inner characters) to the provided words.  Do not apply this
abbreviation if the word has no inner characters.


## Input

The first line is an integer $1 \leq W \leq 100$, the number of word to
abbreviate.  The next $W$ lines are 1 to 30 (inclusive) lowercase ASCII
letters.


## Output

Print $W$ lines where each line is the abbreviated form of the word.


## Example

**Input**

```

**Output**
